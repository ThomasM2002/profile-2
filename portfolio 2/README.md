The focus of this project is to create a profile(resume).Using HTML and css and displaying the correct use of code throughout the project.
It was designed for having all of my information about me all on the one site.
Also the focus while using bootsrap was building for a mobile device how it will look on a mobile device.
Without having to open mutiple files up with a few
simple clicks you are able to see all of my projects that have been built.
How this project works is quite simple basic navigation at the top of the page. Able to click from page to page.
